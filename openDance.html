            <h2>What is Open Dance?</h2>
            <p>Have you ever played the game Just Dance and been like "Man I wish this game was made by a 17 year old and also had no pop music and also was open source"<br>Well you think oddly specific thoughts you need to go to therapy for that</p>
            <p>Open Dance is essentially my version of Just Dance. However, it's gonna have a few differences to make it stand out</p>
            <p>First of all, it'll be fully free and open source (mainly because i probably shouldn't monetize it or else ubisoft will come after me)</p>
            <p>Secondly, a fully fleshed out custom song editor! The visuals for the song will just be video files while any extra data will be stored alongside it. 
                You may be thinking "But i don't have any fancy motion tracking equipment!" Well i got you covered! All the movement for the song will be recorded through a mobile app! (android only sorry ios users) the app will also be used to play the game and select songs!</p>
            <p>Lastly, no pop music! There's 2 reasons I'm doing this: 1. I don't like 99.999% of pop music and 2. I don't want the big record labels coming after me with a shotgun. Of course there's nothing stopping you from making your own pop music maps</p>
            <p>Open Dance is an idea for a game I've had since i was at least 8 years old btw just thought i should mention that</p>
            <p>If you know anything about godot (or gamemaker) game development or want to help with making maps for this game hit me up on discord! (my username is protogenposting)</p>
            <h2>Possible Songs:</h2>
            <p>(keep in mind I likely will not be able to get rights to these songs)</p>
