            <p>It is recommended that all players start by playing Matthew, as they are one of the safest Rogues to use thanks to having alot of health and start exclusively with an almost full deck of Normal Notes, which has the drawback of making his kit tougher to edit with the benefit of potentially dangerous notes appearing less during a track.</p>
