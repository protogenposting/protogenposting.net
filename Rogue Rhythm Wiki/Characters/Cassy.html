            <h1>Strategies</h1>
            <p>Cassy lacks significantly in money gain, but their high hp means you can take on more difficult songs. It is recommended you take on songs at least 40 stars or higher for maximum profit</p>
            <p>If you are an experienced rhythm game player, then it is recommended to stay away from this character, due to their massive downside of low money gain.</p>
