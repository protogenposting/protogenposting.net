                > Google's ability has insane potential for longer runs. As long as you pick songs with uneven and dense notes, you should be able to fully control your deck. <br>
                
                > A funny strategy to pull off would be getting fire notes then tossing out all other note types, essentialy turning the song to autoplay.<br>

                > A much better strategy would be to only have healing notes to become unkillable while being able to still defeat enemies.<br>

                > Google overall is a very versatile character and will likely shred the entire game if used correctly.
