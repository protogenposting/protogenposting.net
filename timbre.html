            <h2>What is Timbre?</h2>
            <p>Timbre is a 2d rhythm game where you follow a path to the music! It's kind of like if you took an 8 key game and put all the notes along a path like a dance of fire and ice</p>
            <p>Unlike my previous rhythm games, Timbre is focused on having a good user interface as well as many quality of life features, such as keybinds, an editor, playlists, and a way to import songs from other games!</p>
            <p>Timbre is also 100% free and open source</p>
            <h2>What can I do with Timbre's code?</h2>
            <p>You can use Timbre's code in pretty much any way you want!</p>
            <p>If you're using small chunks of the code to make your own entirely different rhythm game, you don't need to credit me (but if you do this feel free to tell me so i can feel proud of myself)</p>
            <p>if you're using the entire Timbre engine as a base, then you have to credit me somewhere in the game, ESPECIALLY if the game you're making is going to be commercial</p>
            <p>You're also free to contribute code suggestions for optimization and better documentation on github!</p>
