            <p>PNPR is a physics-based 3D precision platformer where you play as pip, a small red bird, rolling around pug, an absolute ORB of a dog</p>
            <p>the game is inspired by games from the marble blast "series" (and Patricia Taxon's video on the games) and aims to combine the best aspect of each game in the series</p>
            <p>Oh just a warning: since this is a platformer and it's made by me, it's gonna use speedrun tech I'M SORRY I HAVE AN ADDICTION I NEED TO STO</p>
