            <p>Floral Kombat is basically if you took bloons, pvz, and a little bit of star craft, put them in a blender, then turned it on max</p>
            <p>Floral Kombat has went through development hell but is currently on hiatus. The game is going to be completely reworked from the ground up due to the original game having HORRIBLE code.</p>
            <p>The new version of the game will feature much more actual strategy and a ton of new towers, along with removing the hero mechanic and adding extra secret puzzle levels.</p>
