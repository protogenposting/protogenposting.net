            <h2>What is Olivia's Cleanup Crew?'</h2>
            <p>OCC is my first ever STEAM GAME!!! It will feature some of the most polished gameplay I have made for a game, as well as an actually good story???</p>
            <p>The game is basically a spiritual successor to dandy's world since that game uh... that game is REALLY bad in the gameplay department. Me and Sleepy have spent months reworking every mechanic in that game, as well as adding our own, to make the game ACTUALLY FUN</p>
            <h2>What's the gameplay like?</h2>
            <p>Olivia's cleanup crew is a floor-based stealth survival roguelike. You begin in the lobby where you get to select your character and up to 2 trinkets. In the lobby you can also invite up to 8 friends to join your run. Once everyone is ready, you all get in the elevator and begin the actual run.</p>
            <p>Each floor, you must find the required amount of <b>props</b> to progress. You can find props just about anywhere on the floor, as long as its reachable. Each character has a strength stat, which detirmines how many props they can carry without a massive speed debuff being applied. There is also a hard cap of 5 props a character can hold at once. Once you have your stack of props, you must find a chute and deposit them there. Depositing takes 5-20 seconds depending on your character's skill stat and the amount of props being deposited. Once all the props are deposited, you are able to leave the floor.</p>
            <p>Of course, that would be too easy. There are also enemies (called "wickeds") which you must avoid each floor. Each wicked is a corrupted version of once of the playable characters, with a few abilities that make each a unique threat to deal with. Take wicked mabel for example: their main ability is being able to use the chutes across the map to quickly cross from one side of the map to the other, alongside being able to go through spaces that would require crouching. There are usually 2 wickeds per floor but it increases the further you progress</p>
            <h2>How do characters work?</h2>
            <p>Each character has 3-5 abilities alongside a stat spread of Strength, Speed, Skill, Stamina, and Stealth. All characters have a specific playstyle that their stats and abilities lean into. Let's use the previously mentioned <b>Mabel</b> as an example</p>
            <p>Mabel's playstyle is a survivalist, meaning they are mostly focused on sustaining themselves as their abilities don't directly help others. Her abilities include Marble Run, which lets her use chutes to instantly transport across the floor, Marketable Plushie, Which lets her distract idle enemies with a projectile, Uppies, which lets her ride ontop of other non mabel players, and Sugar Rush, which gives her a massive speed boost after eating enough food items. Mabel is intended to be the easiest character to use, since they are one of the main starters you can choose between. Thanks to sleepy for making the movesets for each character, as they are ALL super well designed.</p>
            <h2>But where's my LOREEEEEEE'</h2>
            <p>The lore will be fully accessible just through playing the game, with little theory crafting required. I won't spoil any of the lore here but just know the titular <b>Olivia</b> is pretty important...</p>
            <h2>Mechanical Differences From Dandy's World'</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>No permenantly looping enemies</li>
                <li>Higher speeds add a longer pause timer for stamina regen</li>
                <li>Items have more diverse uses</li>
                <li>No random stat boosts</li>
                <li>Players are able to crouch to fit through tight gaps, regenerate stamina, and gain higher stealth at the cost of speed</li>
                <li>1-5 star speed is a much smaller range</li>
                <li>Game supports modding</li>
                <li>Full Steam Deck and Linux support</li>
            </ul>
