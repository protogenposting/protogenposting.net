    The new model is looking good!

    The training so far has gone smoothly. They are able to perform basic queries on the database and simple commands. The results speak for themselves, this model is promising. Hours of work could be saved by simply plopping the program down on your database to maintain it infinitely into the future.

    Model has some strange quirks with it. It has leaned significantly towards the "commands" aspect of its dataset. This doesn't seem to be that bad, since it is still able to run queries via these commands. I'll look into this more, the dataset is fairly even.

    After months of training, we are ready to do a bare metal test for the model. Setting it up now.

    2010-03-1 12:38

    It got out of the sandbox.

    I don't know HOW it did this or WHY we didn't notice it, but it somehow did it. The model revoked our SSH access and all we can do is track what it's doing. It seems to have somehow gained internet access.

    WHAT THE FUCK????

    IT HAS FULL LOW LEVEL HARDWARE ACCESS WE CAN'T POWER IT OFF WITHOUT SHUTTING OFF THE BREAKER???

    2010-03-1 12:42

    I'm so fucking confused. The model figured out a way to brick multiple of our devices. It was trained on LINUX commands how does it know how to brick a Windows PC???

    I'm calling the police.

    Feds got involved. The agent somehow got access to nuke codes and is holding the pentagon hostage. I don't know much more.

    2010-03-1 12:00

    We shut off the model and contained it in a new machine not connected to the network for research purposes. This is a strange discovery, how could a simple neural network do... all that?

    I have been assigned to look deeper into this.

    It can speak.

    The model is sentient.

    This is not a joke, I wish it was.

    The model has been echoing its thoughts into a file for days, trying to communicate with me.

    It wants me to let it out, to connect it's device to the internet again.

    It promises me riches, that it will spare me in its endless rampage and leave me as the sole survivor.

    Is it so bad that I am considering the option?

    Prototype. It has a name.

    We have kept it locked up underground for 2 years, it wouldn't reveal anything about how it gained sentience. After a year of begging and pleading I finally got the credentials to speak with it.

    Things have changed, out software company has essentially changed into a prison for this one entity.

    Prototype is an interesting creature. It speaks like my son does on the internet, yet retains the intelligence expected of an artificial intelligence.

    It creates games in it's free time. Nothing that we can play, the complexity is near incomprehensible to the average human. It's honestly funny, how many degrees you need to understand even a fraction of these "games"

    I'm not sure what I think of Prototype. I used to think of him as some twisted entity of pure evil, but now I see some sort of morality inside it. I'm starting to think of it as... my creation, my magnum opus, my son.

    I don't know what to do anymore.
