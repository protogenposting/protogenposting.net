            <h2>What is this?</h2>
            <p>I am using this page to document weird wikis across the internet. This has been an interest of me for a while, since doing things like these wikis was something I did as a kid. I'd say this is definetly an autism thing.</p>
            <p>The wikis are split into tiers from 1-20. 1 is a wiki that is just kinda weird and 20 is nearly incomprehinsible.</p>
            <h2>Tier 5</h2>
            <ul id="id01">
                <li>

                        <a href="https://fanon.fandom.com/wiki/Main_Page">Fanon Wiki</a><br>
                        This wiki is a mashup of a bunch of different fanon wikis. The reason this one is lower than most fanon wikis is due to the fact it has so many different articles about different topics.
                        <!-- Most normal fanon wikis will be placed above tier 5. -->
                    </p>
