            <h2>Wow I Remembered!</h2>
            <p>Didn't expect it but I actually remembered to write a blog post today</p>
            <p>I'm in Nashville rn waiting for the next plane since my family is on a trip to florida, thankfully phigros works on a plane so i can play that. My headphones don't work on my pc since i don't have an aux cord though :(</p>
            <p>Main thing I'm gonna do in florida is go searching for DDR, PIU, and ITG arcade machines because I have a crippling rhythm game addiction</p>
            <p>Anyways, I don't have any news for my projects today, so I'll mostly be doing some ranting!!!</p>
            <h2>Fuck Microsoft</h2>
            <p>The only laptop I have on me is a SMELLY WINDOWS LAPTOP. I got it from my mom a few years ago so I could do programming on vacation</p>
            <p>Microsoft decided it should store ALL MY DOCUMENTS FOLDER on onedrive. Like seriously who willingly uses onedrive??? Even google drive works better</p>
            <p>Besides this laptop, I've been Windows free for a few months now. It's been amazing, the only thing i had trouble on was setting up my vr headset.</p>
            <h2>Vr and Linux</h2>
            <p>Speaking of VR, I really love it so far! The only games I've played so far on it are beatsaber and vr chat, both have worked very well!</p>
            <p>I'm really glad i was able to find a vr headset that just connected to your pc without having any logins or data stealing</p>
            <p>The only two that fit that criteria (that i've found so far) are the original HTC Vive and the steam deck (both made by valve)</p>
            <p>I got the htc vive since it was much cheaper to get used</p>
            <p>Hopefully I can remember to make that <a href="/games subpages/beatBlock.html">Vr Game</a> I wanted to make</p>
            <h2>Ideas For Open Dance Songs</h2>
            <p>Yeah <a href="/games subpages/openDance.html">Open Dance</a> lives in my head rent free lol</p>
            <p>Here's some songs I'll add in the future and what I think their design might be like</p>
            <p>USAO - Chariot might be the demo song for the game since I feel like it really encapsulates the vibe I'm going for with the game. Expect a lot of shuffling in the choreography</p>
            <p>
                Riya - Amazing to Me is one I'm definetly gonna add. 
                I've heard people complain about every duo just dance song being the same and I can definetly see why. 
                They all use basically the same moves (this is coming from someone who barely knows anything about the just dance games past 2017). 
                So how would i fix this? Easy! MAKE IT GAY
                Yeah that's right, this game is gonna have MEN KISSING!!! well prob not kissing since making 2 recordings of myself kiss would probably be really weird so uhhh
                Also the song is a lot more upbeat and faster tempoed than the love songs just dance uses so it basically automatically more fun
            </p>
            <p>
                Charlie Darker & Far Too Loud - Nail Gun is another one I wanted to add, but idk if i will since it might copyright claim videos of it, which is a problem with just dance that i wanna fix with this game
                Anyways, the choreography would probably take place in a construction site, with a lot of camera rotation and movment going on in the bacakground.
            </p>
            <p>
                Droptek - Explode is probably the first song i thought of adding, and is the song with the most planned out choreography (It's all on my head)
                This song would have a guy in a factory of sorts with a bunch of sawblades and stuff.
            </p>
            <p>
                Yooh - Magic is the last one I'm gonna mention today.
                Normally I'd consider Crazy Shuffle due to it's use in so many dancing rhythm games,
                but i think magic by yooh deserves some love, it only has 1.6k views on Youtube right now!
                To be honest, it kind of sounds like crazy shuffle structurally if it had a bit more hardbass
            </p>
            <p>
                Anyways I'm also planning on adding some goofy little goobers you can customize that will show up next to your pfp.
                These would bop up and down to the music, and make customizable expressions whenever you get a rating (such as good, perfect, etc.)
            </p>
            <h2>The Best Wings of Fire Fanfiction Genre</h2>
            <p>
                So I've noticed a new genre of WOF fanfiction pop up recently. 
                Basically it involves some character who is definetly a self insert being transported to WOF and becoming a dragon.
                If you write this kind of fanfic, PLEASE KEEP DOING IT I LOVE THIS TYPE OF FANFIC SO MUCH.
                Even I wrote one (it's bad don't try to read it)
            </p>
