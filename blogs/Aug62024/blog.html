            <h2>Wow funny blog</h2>
            <p>So real quick, lemme say that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCP08Gm2pbUFdd2AfhYuyt-w">Psychcool</a> was the one to inspire me to add a blog to this site so uh yeah thank youuuuuuuuuuu</p>
            <p><br>Ok so anyways, these blogs are basically gonna be me autistically rambling about stuff I like and stuff related to my game. I'll have a little header above each section on what it's about. Dm me on discord if you have any critscism!</p>
            <h2>Timbre</h2>
            <p>The next <a href="/games subpages/timbre.html">Timbre</a> update, 3rd Mix, is coming along nicely! Here's a teaser image of acorn guy doin a dance!</p>
            <img src="Acorn.gif"></img>
            <p>I also got a few more artists on the project! Paranoise with their track <a href="https://paranoiseband.bandcamp.com/track/crystal">Crystal</a> and Perfectionist Peppino with a (currently) unnamed song! Thanks for donating to the project!</p>
            <p>Timbre's online api is also making steady progress! There was a small hiccup with how gamemaker formats its post requests but that was fixed thankfully :3</p>
            <h2>Comic Idea</h2>
            <p>Ok so for some reason my dreams sometimes give me BANGER show/comic ideas, like nervepocalypse was conceived from a dream where my youth group leader became a zombie after trying to kill everyone (you can tell I don't like youth group :3)</p>
            <p>Anyways I had a dream like a week ago and it gave me another BANGER comic idea. So lemme explain it</p>
            <p>So basically it was kinda like pokemon if pokemon was written more like beyblade metal fusion and the character designs of slugterra (with a hint of hornyness)</p>
            <p>So I had the idea that i should make a comic parodying early 2000's "toy animes" (western animes made specifically to sell toys). I think it could be funny but my drawing skills aren't super good atm</p>
            <h2>New Game???</h2>
            <p>Yea I'm working on another game >:3</p>
            <p>It's called Pip N Pug Rollout. It's kind of like marble blast if you made it actually decent and also added TOO MUCH SPEEDRUN TECH</p>
            <p>It's also my first 3D game! Well not really my first but my first attempt at making an actual game in 3D</p>
            <h2>Closing</h2>
            <p>Well, that's all I have for now, I'll be back in like a week or a day depending on when I have something new to say</p>
